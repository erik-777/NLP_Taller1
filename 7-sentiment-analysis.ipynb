film festival . \\nit may not be clear to the viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the running time . \\nin fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry . \\ntoward the end of the film i think everything that has been built falls apart . \\nthe film was to be a pilot for a tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot and i think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it . \\nsomething else is what he did . \\nthe film opens with a woman ( played by laura harring ) about to be killed in a car when a car crash saves her life . \\nshe crawls away from the accident with a concussion and finds herself a bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep . \\nmeanwhile young vivacious betty ( naomi watts ) arrives in hollywood from canada . \\nshe wants to build a career as an actress . \\nbetty is a little surprised to find a woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow . \\nshe does not know who the woman is . \\nshe is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not herself know who she is . \\nthey fix on a name rita for her , but are not sure if this right or not . \\nmeanwhile local director adam kesher ( justin theroux ) has problems of his own . \\nhe is trying to cast one actress for his new film and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to cast someone else , cammie rhodes ( melissa george ) . \\nthese two threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong . \\nthere is also a strange character called the cowboy ( monty montgomery ) adding to the confusion . \\nin what was probably intended for the television pilot the film opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the credits . \\na lot of mulholland drive starts out fun . \\nlynch wants you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film . \\nhe just chooses not to . \\nas with any david lynch film there is strange material added for little reason . \\nthere are no earthworms , but there are some decidedly strange david lynch touches . \\nthe film is a little long for the subject matter . \\ntoward the end it gets into some heavier violence and sex scenes , clearly not intended for the tv pilot . \\nunfortunately some of the most important comments to make about this film would be spoilers . \\ni will not mention them in the main body of the review but i give mulholland drive a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\nmulholland drive spoiler warning . \\ni have rated this film fairly low . \\nyou should read this only after seeing the film or deciding that you will not see the film . \\ndavid lynch is in large part a dark satirist . \\nmost of his work is done in familiar genres but in some way shows their underside . \\nin mulholland drive i think he is having a laugh at the expense of the crime film genre . \\nwhat he does with this film is ( are you sure you want to read this ? ) \\nplaying off the audience expectations that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on . \\nthe first 80% of the film he tells a simple multi-thread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout . \\nthen suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something . \\nthe audience expectation is that they will add up . \\nbut he has given clues that are self-contradictory . \\nlynch wants the audience to argue about what they have seen afterward and come up with theories . \\nin fact , the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until i hear a better explanation , i think lynch is merely playing a joke . \\nthere is a visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties . \\nmad magazine called it a poiuyt . \\nother sources called it a tri- pronged u-bar . \\nlook at small portions of it and makes sense . \\nlook at the whole figure and it does not . \\nthis film is , in my estimation , the cinematic equivalent of a tri-pronged u-bar . \\n\",\n          \"unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi , an artist whose palette is fabric . \\nostensibly , the film is a documentary , but use of that term requires stretching its meaning . \\nmany scenes appear staged , and a great deal of cutting-and-pasting has been done in the editing room . \\nthe cinema verite effect is a conceit -- genuine spontaneity is at a premium , and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera ( especially would-be actresses like cindy crawford ) . \\ndirector douglas keeve ( who was mizrahi's lover at the time ) freely admits that he \\\" couldn't care less about the truth \\\" but was more interested in capturing \\\" the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion . \\\" \\ndespite violating nearly every rule of \\\" legitimate \\\" documentary film making , however , unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment . \\nwhile it sheds only a little light on the behind-the-scenes world of the fashion industry , it presents a fascinating , if incomplete , picture of designer mizrahi . \\nthis man is the perfect subject for this kind of study -- he's funny , energetic , and eminently quotable . \\nhe has unusual views on just about everything , from fashion ( \\\" it's about women not wanting to look like cows \\\" ) to mary tyler moore ( \\\" between her and jackie kennedy , they shaped this country \\\" ) to style ( \\\" it's almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dogs \\\" ) . \\nunzipped also gives a glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turns an idea into a dress . \\nit's almost certainly different that anyone would imagine . \\nthe designer draws on a variety of sources for his look , including nanook of the north and old bette davis movies , then enlists the aid of a ouija board to help form the collection . \\nin particular , unzipped traces mizrahi's development of his fall 1994 line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show , which highlights a number of prominent models , including cindy crawford , naomi campbell , kate bush , and linda evangelista . \\non the technical side , a number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped . \\na variety of film stocks were used : super 8 , 16 mm black-and-white , and 35 mm color . \\nthere is a purpose to this beyond simple artiness -- the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie , and , during the climactic fashion show , color is used to show the audience's perspective , while black-and-white is for the behind-the- scenes sequences . \\nnevertheless , some viewers will be put off by this treatment . \\nwhile unzipped isn't an expose on the fashion industry per se , keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear . \\noverall , however , this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else , and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed . \\nwhen the designer declares that \\\" everything is frustrating except designing clothes -- that's beautiful and liberating , \\\" it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed . \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n

, it was reintroduced to theaters the same day fox's animated film anastasia was released . \\nyou know disney , they can't deal with the threat of any other studio getting even a small piece of the crust of the kiddie entertainment pie , so when someone else wants to make a little money , they counter with an old \\\" masterpiece \\\" from their vault and , you know what , i went to see this 1989 cartoon rather than the brand new one from fox . \\nlet no one say disney is losing its monopoly on the market . \\nthey still have hotels on boardwalk _and_ park place . \\nbelieve it or not , today , november 25 , 1997 , at 5 : 05 p . m . , i saw the little mermaid for the first time . \\nit took me a few years to get over an aversion to this movie that was caused seven years ago , when i stayed with one of my mom's friends for a couple weeks . \\nthey had a young child who listened to the little mermaid soundtrack constantly and , over that two week period , i heard every song from the movie probably a hundred times . \\nby the time i got back home , i promised myself i'd never see the movie . \\nbut promises are made to be broken , especially when you're looking at a 17-day , limited engagement . \\ndamn those shrewd disney marketers and their mind games . \\nthe little mermaid is based on a hans christian anderson fairy tale , but it's disney-ized , which means lots of talking animals and bursting into song . \\nit also means the heroine is a total babe who shows off cleavage from a seashell bra at all times . \\ni never wanted so much to be a pair of shells . . . \\nthe heroine , of course , is ariel ( voice of jodi benson ) , a 16-year-old mermaid who is going through that rebellious phase . \\nshe skips her concert to explore a wrecked ship and hang out with a seagull that talks like buddy hackett , who tries to orient her to the mysterious world of humans . \\nshe's also dealing with feelings she hasn't had before -- which comes when you get scales in places you didn't use to have them -- about a handsome prince ( no disney movie would be complete without one ) . \\nher father , king triton of the merpeople , strictly forbids such lusting after the ways of the \\\" savage \\\" humans , in a condemnation that reads as a not-so-subtle analogy about old- fashioned parents who forbid interracial dating . \\nwhat's a king to do , though ? \\nthe girl's in love and even total destruction of her little shrine to the human world doesn't deter her . \\nariel saves the prince's life when a hurricane rises up , and just has to meet him . \\nshe makes a deal with ursula , the sea witch ( voice of pat carroll ) . \\nyou know she's evil because she has a huge potbelly and one of the worst asses in cartoon history . \\nshe also has octopus tentacles for feet ( something those dr . scholl's corn pads will not fix ) and offers to help ariel out . \\nshe'll make her a human for three days if ariel will give up her pretty voice ; ariel has three days to make that prince kiss her , or else she becomes a slave to the witch forever . \\nand if she pricks her finger on a sewing machine or eats an evil apple , she'll fall asleep forever . \\nit's a simplistic plot , yes , but the little mermaid was a revolution in the disney world , coming after such lackluster efforts as the black cauldron and oliver and company . \\nit ranks as one of the best disney cartoons , certainly since the '50s . \\nall the elements are there -- memorable songs like \\\" under the sea \\\" and \\\" kiss the girl , \\\" cartoon animals like sebastian and flounder , an evil villain who still has characterization and charm , and a fair amount of humor that caters to adults as well as children . \\nthe little mermaid is worth a big-screen ticket in 1997 , so hurry up , you only have five days left . \\nserving america for more than 1/25th of a century !\",\n          \"it's been a long time since walt disney has delivered us a classic along the lines of the little mermaid or beauty and the beast . \\nsure , there have been delightful outings like last years hercules . \\nbut nothing entirely groundbreaking . \\nwith the release of the studio's newest feature length film , a remake of edgar rice burrough's creation tarzan , disney has plunged into new waters with both maturity and animation techniques . \\nit's no classic , but this new tarzan represents exactly what a family film should be . \\nthe plot is loyal to the original storyline , as tarzan's parents are forced to abandon their ship which has caught fire , and find shelter in the jungles of africa . \\nbut , they are killed ( offscreen ) by the snarling cheetah sabor , leaving baby tarzan alone and unharmed in his crib . \\nfound by kala ( voiced with effective gentleness by glenn close ) , a kindhearted mother and member of a gorilla pack , tarzan is taken into the primate group and raised as one of their own . \\nwe follow the young boy through the years , as he partakes in various adventures with his loud mouth gorilla friend terk ( a very brash but funny rosie o'donnell ) and clumsy elephant tantor ( wayne knight ) . \\nof course , in any disney film we are given some kind of goofy sidekick or humorous chum for the hero . \\nin tarzan , these characters fill that space rather inconspicuously . \\ngags that were magnified in other family films are kept quite minor here . \\nmost of the characters are amusing without being forced . \\nas tarzan grows to manhood , the suspected antagonist stumbles into the picture . \\nhere , the notorious bad guy is the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , who's accompanying a hapless professor ( nigel hawthorne ) on an expedition through the jungle . \\nof course , there's the professor's daughter , jane ( nicely vocalized by a cheerful minnie driver ) who will help supply the romantic quotient of the movie . \\nthe thing that blew my socks off about this version of tarzan is the stunning animation . \\ndirectors chris buck and kevin lima have applied a breathtaking 3-d element to the movement of the athletic title character , and the fast-paced editing is absolutely a marvel . \\nas tarzan carries jane through the treetops , narrowly escaping a pack of nasty baboons , he slips and slides like a daredevil snow boarder or star surfer riding the big wave . \\nyour eyes can barely keep up ; it's a fantastic accomplishment . \\nthe subject matter here is also a notch or two above animation average . \\nthere are important questions raised about tarzan's place in the world , and all are handled exceptionally well by the screenwriters . \\nthere is no shred of doubt left to ponder afterward , which is a surprising plus that i wasn't expecting to find here . \\nsuffice to say , this film will have both adults and children thoroughly entertained . \\nthe grown-up tarzan is voiced by tony goldwyn , who made a name for himself as the `big mean jerk' from ghost . \\ngoldwyn is effective playing someone who's not aware of his world's dangers . \\nglenn close is also memorable as his gorilla mother , and lance henriksen ( from tv's millennium ) is terrific as the silverback father unsure of how to accept the presence of a human child . \\nas the movie's villain , there is nothing particularly special or catching about the character of clayton . \\nit helps that brian blessed supplies his voice with game enthusiasm , but he is nothing compared to james woods' hilarious hades from hercules . \\na burley guy with a big gun who just wants to capture the gorillas does not quite constitute for an all-together noticeable screen presence . \\nstill , this is one great thrill-ride that disney has constructed . \\ni never expected rice burrough's work to be transformed so successfully from live action to animation , nor with so much emotional depth . \\nparents , along with all the kiddies , are going to find much to like in tarzan .\"\n        ],\n

ariel has three days to make that prince kiss her , or else she becomes a slave to the witch forever . \\nand if she pricks her finger on a sewing machine or eats an evil apple , she'll fall asleep forever . \\nit's a simplistic plot , yes , but the little mermaid was a revolution in the disney world , coming after such lackluster efforts as the black cauldron and oliver and company . \\nit ranks as one of the best disney cartoons , certainly since the '50s . \\nall the elements are there -- memorable songs like \\\" under the sea \\\" and \\\" kiss the girl , \\\" cartoon animals like sebastian and flounder , an evil villain who still has characterization and charm , and a fair amount of humor that caters to adults as well as children . \\nthe little mermaid is worth a big-screen ticket in 1997 , so hurry up , you only have five days left . \\nserving america for more than 1/25th of a century !\",\n          \"it's been a long time since walt disney has delivered us a classic along the lines of the little mermaid or beauty and the beast . \\nsure , there have been delightful outings like last years hercules . \\nbut nothing entirely groundbreaking . \\nwith the release of the studio's newest feature length film , a remake of edgar rice burrough's creation tarzan , disney has plunged into new waters with both maturity and animation techniques . \\nit's no classic , but this new tarzan represents exactly what a family film should be . \\nthe plot is loyal to the original storyline , as tarzan's parents are forced to abandon their ship which has caught fire , and find shelter in the jungles of africa . \\nbut , they are killed ( offscreen ) by the snarling cheetah sabor , leaving baby tarzan alone and unharmed in his crib . \\nfound by kala ( voiced with effective gentleness by glenn close ) , a kindhearted mother and member of a gorilla pack , tarzan is taken into the primate group and raised as one of their own . \\nwe follow the young boy through the years , as he partakes in various adventures with his loud mouth gorilla friend terk ( a very brash but funny rosie o'donnell ) and clumsy elephant tantor ( wayne knight ) . \\nof course , in any disney film we are given some kind of goofy sidekick or humorous chum for the hero . \\nin tarzan , these characters fill that space rather inconspicuously . \\ngags that were magnified in other family films are kept quite minor here . \\nmost of the characters are amusing without being forced . \\nas tarzan grows to manhood , the suspected antagonist stumbles into the picture . \\nhere , the notorious bad guy is the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , who's accompanying a hapless professor ( nigel hawthorne ) on an expedition through the jungle . \\nof course , there's the professor's daughter , jane ( nicely vocalized by a cheerful minnie driver ) who will help supply the romantic quotient of the movie . \\nthe thing that blew my socks off about this version of tarzan is the stunning animation . \\ndirectors chris buck and kevin lima have applied a breathtaking 3-d element to the movement of the athletic title character , and the fast-paced editing is absolutely a marvel . \\nas tarzan carries jane through the treetops , narrowly escaping a pack of nasty baboons , he slips and slides like a daredevil snow boarder or star surfer riding the big wave . \\nyour eyes can barely keep up ; it's a fantastic accomplishment . \\nthe subject matter here is also a notch or two above animation average . \\nthere are important questions raised about tarzan's place in the world , and all are handled exceptionally well by the screenwriters . \\nthere is no shred of doubt left to ponder afterward , which is a surprising plus that i wasn't expecting to find here . \\nsuffice to say , this film will have both adults and children thoroughly entertained . \\nthe grown-up tarzan is voiced by tony goldwyn , who made a name for himself as the `big mean jerk' from ghost . \\ngoldwyn is effective playing someone who's not aware of his world's dangers . \\nglenn close is also memorable as his gorilla mother , and lance henriksen ( from tv's millennium ) is terrific as the silverback father unsure of how to accept the presence of a human child . \\nas the movie's villain , there is nothing particularly special or catching about the character of clayton . \\nit helps that brian blessed supplies his voice with game enthusiasm , but he is nothing compared to james woods' hilarious hades from hercules . \\na burley guy with a big gun who just wants to capture the gorillas does not quite constitute for an all-together noticeable screen presence . \\nstill , this is one great thrill-ride that disney has constructed . \\ni never expected rice burrough's work to be transformed so successfully from live action to animation , nor with so much emotional depth . \\nparents , along with all the kiddies , are going to find much to like in tarzan .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"scores\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"compound\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.8491773392769579,\n        \"min\": -0.9996,\n        \"max\": 0.9999,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1044,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.9138,\n          0.9814\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prediction\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"pos\",\n          \"neg\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":40}],"source":["# Se ajusta Threshold a 0.05 para mejorar resultado en negativos\n","reviews['compound'] = reviews.scores.apply(lambda s: s['compound'])\n","# reviews['prediction'] = reviews['compound'].apply(lambda c: 'pos' if c > 0 else 'neg')\n","reviews['prediction'] = reviews['compound'].apply(lambda c: 'pos' if c > 0.05 else 'neg')\n","reviews.head()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"JTF6WhJLCbjq"},"source":["Y finalmente computar unas cuantas métricas de calidad del modelo:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":41,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"z8Af3gGcCbjr","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1771621173509,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":11,"user":{"displayName":"Ivan Felipe Moran Pelaez","userId":"07993616660853390417"}},"outputId":"be268075-d447-4b37-de3d-dcb2f39ec44c"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Accuracy:\n","0.6357069143446853\n","\n","Classification Report:\n","              precision    recall  f1-score   support\n","\n","         neg       0.72      0.44      0.55       969\n","         pos       0.60      0.83      0.70       969\n","\n","    accuracy                           0.64      1938\n","   macro avg       0.66      0.64      0.62      1938\n","weighted avg       0.66      0.64      0.62      1938\n","\n","Confusion Matrix:\n","[[427 542]\n"," [164 805]]\n"]}],"source":["from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report\n","\n","y_true = reviews.label.values\n","y_pred = reviews.prediction.values\n","\n","acc = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)\n","cm = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)\n","cr = classification_report(y_true, y_pred)\n","\n","\n","print(f\"Accuracy:\\n{acc}\\n\")\n","print(f\"Classification Report:\\n{cr}\")\n","print(f\"Confusion Matrix:\\n{cm}\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ia8TBKXfCbjr"},"source":["La correctitud no es la mejor, aún podemos hacerlo mucho mejor que la línea base (50%).
